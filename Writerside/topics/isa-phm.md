# ISA for PHM

The original ISA model was developed to capture metadata for the field of life, environmental and biomedical sciences such as toxicology and plant sciences.

Terms and definitions common in these fields are not common in the field of PHM. Hence, a model extension was made that provided clearer definitions for the PHM community.
